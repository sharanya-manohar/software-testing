Setting Up a Git Repository and Deploying a FastAPI Project on Render

1. Create a New Git Repository
Do not add a README file initially.
Copy and execute the following commands to initialize the repository and make the first commit:

echo "# new" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/sharanya-manohar/new.git
git push -u origin main


2. Activate the Virtual Environment
Ensure the virtual environment is activated before proceeding:

source ~/profile/scripts/activate {profile}


3. Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into the project directory where all project files are stored:

cd ~/projects/profile


4. Add All Files to the Staging Area
Stage all files in the profile directory to prepare them for commit:

git add .


5. Commit the Changes
Save the staged changes in the local repository:

git commit -m "adding project to remote repo"


6. Push Changes to the Remote Repository
Upload the committed changes to GitHub:

git push -u origin main
Alternatively, use:
git push


7. Set Up Deployment on Render
Open Render.
Click Get Started and sign in using GitHub.
Grant permission only for selected repositories and select the one containing the project.


8. Configure the Web Service
Navigate to Web Services.
Choose Git Provider and select the appropriate repository.
